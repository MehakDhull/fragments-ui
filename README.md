# ðŸ§© Fragments Project â€” Lab 2

## ðŸ“š Lab 2 Overview

This lab focused on securely connecting a client web application to a protected backend microservice using **Amazon Cognito** for authentication. The core goal was to implement user sign-in via a hosted login UI and secure API access using JWT-based authentication. You configured:

- Amazon Cognito User Pool (authentication provider)
- A Node.js microservice with secure routes (`/v1/fragments`)
- A frontend client (with Parcel) that allows users to log in and fetch protected data using their tokens

Successful login results in a JWT, which is passed in the `Authorization` header for secure API requests.
